 <summary><h3>üë®‚ÄçüíªDivyansh's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
 I was a software engineering student at Haaga-Helia University, and my dream was to become a full-stack developer.

My journey with coding started in high school, where I studied Python and SQL. I was always fascinated by technology and had a natural talent for programming. As I progressed through high school, my passion for software development grew stronger.

When I entered university, I decided to explore web development. I began with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and soon I was creating interactive web pages. I was hooked, and that's when I discovered the powerful React library. With React, I could bring my web pages to life with dynamic and elegant user interfaces.

But I knew that to become a full-stack developer, I needed to learn backend technologies as well. So, I embraced Node.js and Express to handle server-side development. Building RESTful APIs and managing data requests became second nature to me.

With a solid understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies, I decided to challenge myself further. I explored Java and the Spring Framework, which opened up a whole new world of possibilities. Spring Framework allowed me to build robust and scalable web applications.

As my knowledge and skills grew, I began building full-stack projects using the MERN stack‚Äîcombining Java for the backend and React for the frontend.

I made sure to document my projects and showcase them in a portfolio. I was always eager to learn and stayed up to date with the latest web development trends and technologies.

Along the way, I took on internships and freelance work, gaining real-world experience in web development. Each project was an opportunity to learn and grow, and I was determined to make my mark in the field.

As time went on, my reputation as a skilled full-stack developer spread, and I started receiving job offers from leading tech companies. It was a thrilling time, and I felt incredibly proud of how far I had come.

And so, my coding journey reached a triumphant and fulfilling conclusion. From a software engineering student with a passion for Python and SQL to a seasoned and sought-after full-stack developer, my story inspired many others to pursue their dreams in the world of technology.

And I continue to code and create marvelous digital wonders in the ever-evolving world of software development.
