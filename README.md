 <summary><h3>üë®‚ÄçüíªDivyansh's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about the programming world - code, Unix, Linux, theory. During that time, I taught myself iOS development with a dream to build my own app. However, that dream soon got overshadowed by my desire to excel in Java, which eventually landed me a full-stack software engineering job upon graduation.

   However, throughout this journey, I had another desire I had been pursuing - YouTube content creation. Eventually, I decided to quit my software engineering job to pursue YouTube full-time, and that has been my focus ever since.

   But there's something that has always bothered me about my journey - abandoning my dream of building my own app to pursue the safe route of a job. Now, I've already taken the leap away from that safety net into this uncomfortable, unexplored world of being a creator. And it worked out, but it became comfortable. It's easier to create videos than to go out on a limb and build my own product.

   I have a burning desire to get back on the horse and fulfill that younger me's dream of building my own app, my own product. And in order to do that, I'm implementing measures to streamline my YouTube content and focus more time on fulfilling that dream - a dream that I'll be ready to tackle in 2023 due to the measures I'm putting in place until the end of 2022.

   Don't wait up because I'm coming.
